# Hi there 👋
Welcome to my profile.

I'm Suelen Batista, a Front-End Developer based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷
I work mainly with Web applications, focusing on building scalable, accessible, and well-structured interfaces.

I have experience developing and maintaining complex front-end solutions using React and TypeScript, collaborating on multiple projects, and contributing to design system development to ensure consistency and scalability across products.

#

### 💻 What I do:
- Build and evolve Web applications using modern front-end technologies
- Develop reusable UI components and contribute to design system initiatives
- Support the adoption of internal design systems across existing applications
- Contribute to framework and dependency upgrades, including major React version migrations
- Work on feature implementation, bug fixing, and code reviews
- Care deeply about code quality, maintainability, accessibility, and user experience

#

### 🧠 Background
Before transitioning to software development, I earned a degree in Architecture and Urbanism, where I developed strong skills in design thinking, structure, and problem-solving — all of which I apply today when building user interfaces.

I enjoy continuous learning and improving my understanding of performance, scalability, and security in front-end applications.
